# Layered (N-Tier) Architecture
> by Wei-Jen and Evan

## Setup
1. Navigate to `layered/` _(you should already be here)_
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `tsc` to compile the Typescript into the `build/` dir
4. Run `node build/index.js` to run to file!

> Side notes: The JSON saving and reading is the 10th option in the UI now. Additionally, upon quitting the app, the user is prompted to save the current JSON instance in a local JSON file.
