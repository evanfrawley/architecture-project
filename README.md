# Architected Resistance

This repo contains code for two different versions of an application to manage political resistance actions, created as part of an assignment for the [Software Architecture](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1100150) course at the UW iSchool. Each version utilizes an architectural style:

1. ((Name first style here))
2. ((Name second style here))

See the individual folders for more details.


### Architectural Analysis
> In the space below (replacing these lines), address the following questions about the architecture of your implementation:

> 1. Discuss how effectively each architectural style was individually at supporting the features of this particular application? What were the benefits and drawbacks of following that style? Be sure to justify your responses with specifics!

> 2. Discussed how effectively&mdash;_in theory_&mdash;each architectural style would support the "additional feature" required by the other. For example, if you did Client-Server and Pipe-and-Filter versions, you should discuss how well client-server might support data processing, and how well pipe-and-filter might support multiple multiple organizers collaborating. Be sure to justify your responses with specifics!
